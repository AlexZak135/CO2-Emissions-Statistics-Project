# CO2-Emissions-Statistics-Project

## Background
Over the past three decades, climate change has emerged as a pressing global concern, with CO2 emissions from vehicles playing a substantial role in exacerbating this issue. Experts predict that this year, CO2 emissions from vehicles will surpass three billion metric tons, further intensifying the upward trend in temperatures and sea levels. To mitigate the adverse effects of vehicle-related CO2 emissions, one solution is for manufacturers to produce low or zero-emission vehicles. This initiative has been underway for years, as exemplified by Toyota's introduction of the world's first mass-produced hybrid vehicle in 1997. However, additional measures are needed to effectively combat climate change. This realization underscores the importance of developing innovative strategies that raise public awareness about the impact of vehicle-related CO2 emissions and promote the adoption of sustainable practices.

## Research Question and Data Overview
The primary research question that guided this analysis aimed to identify the most influential predictor or combination of predictors for the levels of CO2 emissions emitted by vehicles. To address this question, a comprehensive data set was obtained from the official open data website of the Canadian government. The data set encompasses information on 7,385 vehicles manufactured across Asia, North America, and Europe over a span of seven years. In its original form, the data set includes nine variables, with six being categorical and the remaining three being numeric. Additional variables were created by applying transformations to existing variables as well as implementing feature engineering techniques.

## Methodology
This project consisted of three main steps. First, the initial data preprocessing was conducted to perform tasks such as data cleaning and formatting to ensure the data was ready for analysis. Following that, an exploratory analysis was carried out, which involved descriptive statistics, correlation tests, chi-squared tests, visualization, and ANOVA. These techniques provided insights into the relationships between variables and their impact on CO2 emissions. Finally, multiple causal inference models were developed using polynomial regression and logistic regression. The findings from this analysis provide valuable insights into the vehicle characteristics that have the greatest impact on CO2 emissions, enhancing our understanding of the attributes that contribute to the development of more eco-friendly vehicles. By identifying these influential factors, policymakers, automakers, and consumers can make informed decisions aimed at reducing the carbon footprint of the transportation sector.
